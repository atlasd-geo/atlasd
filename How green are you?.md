# How green are you?

## Like, this is my first time on Github, lol.
Sweet! Welcome aboard sailor. We recommend taking the following steps:
1. Let's set up your stack:
    1. Most of the repos in this project are going to be much easier to work with using VSCode. [Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) it for your OS.
    2. In VSCode, we recommend you install the following extensions:
        - [Folder Templates](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Huuums.vscode-fast-folder-structure)
        - [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
    3. Get yourself familiar with VSCode [snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets). These are recommended throughout the project.
2. Set yourself up with [SSH key access](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh). This isn't necessary for these repos, but it's a good practice and should hopefully get you warmed up and maybe teach you a thing or two.
3. For additional practice, create your own repo.
4. Read [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). It will be important that you understand this before you start contributing, but don't stress too much. There's time to practice.
5. When you're ready, head over to [Contribution Guidelines]().

## I have a bit of experience.
Right on. We recommend VSCode and the extensions above. Other recommendations will be provided on a repo-by-repo bases. When you're ready, head over to [Contribution Guidelines]().

## I'm a vet.
You probably aren't reading this.
