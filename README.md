# Atlasd
Welcome to Atlasd! If you're new to the project, we encourage you to read all of the information below before getting started.


## Overview
Atlasd (say "at last!"; think Atlas) aims to be **web-first mapping application.** Atlasd strives to empower developers, low-code, and no-code users to create cartographic content on the web, for the web. In contrast to services like ArcGIS online and MangoMap, Atlasd intends to be free and open-source.

Grandiose aside, Atlasd is above all else supposed to a *fun* open source project. We hope folks of all skills and interests can try, fail, learn, grow, and maybe even succeed. As you read through, we hope you'll be convinced that there is something for every kind of developer, or even simply thinker, to add to this project.

## Why a mapping web application?
Generally, because a mapping web application can benefit from lots of different kinds of contributions. But, I'll take this question in two parts: why web application? and why mapping?

### Why web application?
Web applications are ubiquitous today for good reason. You can build something user-friendly quickly, you can layer on complexity progressively, and you can pull from a vast and transparent ecosystem of web technologies. For a contributor, there are seemingly endless ways to get involved in web application development as a complete N00B, a hardened vet, or anything in between:
- Commit a new component for the frontend.
- Write a performant data store for the client.
- Design a new logo.
- Build a useful microservice.
- Contribute to the documentation.
- Add a concept to the roadmap.
- Write a template generator.

Whatever it is you want to do, there's a good chance it can be used.

### Why mapping application?
Mapping applications are particularly well-positioned to benefit from the seas of skill and interest:
- Frontends need to be pretty. Hello, the **design-inclined!**
- Frontends need to be infromative. Hello, **content-strat cats!**
- Frontends are complex and need to be fast. Suh, **JS playas.**
- Geoprocessing operations are mathematically intricate. Tidings, ye **math-enthused youths!** 
- Geoprocessing operations consume lots of data. Hi, **O(1) sons!**
- Benefits of separation of concerns and compute are clear. Welcome to the DiscothÃ¨que, **distrotechts.**
- We could use some IoT drivers. Embed yourself here... wait, uh... **embed your sysems here**... ah, language and culture.
- We want people to actually be able to use this beast. Pull up an **external doc** and begin your mentation... alright, alright.
- We want contributors to actually be able to contribute. Than code, language lighter; employ a **technical writer.**
- Time wasted is life lost. Save us, those of **utilities** abilities.
- Vision and decision make for accuracy and precision. Come down amongst the laypeople thou people of **plans** who draw lines in sands.

## Core Values
1. **Chillax:** for once, there are no deadlines. Take your time to comment and fully and formally test your code.
2. **Fail often:** nobody is grading this; nobody is writing a performance review. Just try something. If it breaks, oh well.
3. **Fish the breadth of your seas:** again, folks of all interests. There are many ways to be useful. 
4. **Play nice:** again, folks of all skills.
5. **Humanities are useful:** write something interesting every now and then. It makes reading this shtuff much more entertaining.
