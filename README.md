Welcome to Atlasd! This is the parent repo for the Atlasd project. If you're new to the project, you can get started with the information below.

## Overview
Atlasd (say "at last!", think Atlas) will be a web-first mapping application. By web-first, we mean that Atlasd strives to empower developers, low-code, and no-code users to create cartographic content on the web, for the web. In contrast to services like ArcGIS online and MangoMap, Atlasd intends to be free and open-source.
