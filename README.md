# Atlasd &middot; ![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/atlasd-geo/atlasd/blob/main/Contribution%20Guidelines.md)
Welcome to Atlasd! If you're new to the project, we encourage you to read all of the information below before getting started.


## Overview
Atlasd is a open-source web-first GIS, dubbed "mapping application" herein. If you aren't familiar with GIS, we recommend following along with this [QGIS Quick Start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCnNWyl9qSE) to get a sense of what we hope this can become and, in a dream, exceed.

### The Platform
- Say "at last!"; think Atlas.
- Web-first mapping application. 
- Strives to empower developers, low-code, and no-code users to create cartographic content on the web, for the web. 
- Unlike [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html) and [MangoMap](https://mangomap.com/), intends to be free and open-source.

### The Project
- *Fun* open source project. 
- Invites folks of all skills and interests to try, fail, learn, grow, and maybe even succeed. 
- Microservice-based architecture to encourage asynchronous and independent projects of all kinds.
- As you read through, we hope you'll be convinced that there is something for every kind of developer, or even simply thinker, to add to this project.

## Core Values
1. **Chillax:** for once, there are no deadlines. Take your time to comment and fully and formally test your code.
2. **Fail often:** nobody is grading this; nobody is writing a performance review. Just try something. If it breaks, oh well.
3. **Fish the breadth of your seas:** again, folks of all interests. There are many ways to be useful. 
4. **Play nice:** again, folks of all skills.
5. **Humanities are useful:** write something interesting every now and then. It makes reading this shtuff much more entertaining.
6. **Simple interfaces at all levels**: write software that is easy to work with even if those working with it don't need it do be.

## Getting started

### The Short Way
Find a [toycontribution](https://github.com/atlasd-geo/atlasd/labels/toycontribution) and get going.

### The Long Way
1. Do the [How green are you?](https://github.com/atlasd-geo/atlasd/blob/main/How%20green%20are%20you%3F.md) activity.
2. Read the [Architecture Quickstart](https://github.com/atlasd-geo/atlasd/blob/main/Architecture%20Quickstart.md).
3. Read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/atlasd-geo/atlasd/blob/main/Contribution%20Guidelines.md).
4. Check out the [issues for this repo]() and [Roadmap](https://github.com/atlasd-geo/atlasd/blob/main/Roadmap.md).
5. Pick a repository to contribute to.
6. Read its guidelines.
7. Do its [Quick Start Activity](https://github.com/atlasd-geo/atlasd/blob/main/Contribution%20Guidelines.md#README).
8. Get to work.

## Why a mapping web application?
On the whole, a mapping web application can benefit from lots of different kinds of contributions. But, we'll break this question in two parts: why web application? and why mapping application?

### Why web application?
Web applications are ubiquitous today for good reason. You can build something user-friendly quickly, you can layer on complexity progressively, and you can pull from a vast and transparent ecosystem of web technologies. For a contributor, there are seemingly endless ways to get involved in web application development as a complete N00B, a hardened vet, or anything in between:
- Commit a new component for the frontend.
- Write a performant data store for the client.
- Design a new logo.
- Build a useful microservice.
- Contribute to the documentation.
- Add a concept to the roadmap.
- Write a template generator.

Whatever it is you want to do, there's a good chance it can be used.

### Why mapping application?
Mapping applications are particularly well-positioned to benefit from the seas of skill and interest:
- Frontends need to be pretty. Hello, the **design-inclined!**
- Frontends need to be infromative. Hello, **content-strat cats!**
- Frontends are complex and need to be fast. Suh, **JS playas.**
- Geoprocessing operations are mathematically intricate. Tidings, ye **math-enthused youths!** 
- Geoprocessing operations consume lots of data. Hi, **O(1) sons!**
- Benefits of separation of concerns and compute are clear. Welcome to the Discoth√®que, **distrotechts.**
- We could use some IoT drivers. Embed yourself here... wait, uh... **embed your sysems here**... ah, language and culture.
- We want people to actually be able to use this beast. Pull up an **external doc** and begin your mentation... alright, alright.
- We want contributors to actually be able to contribute. Than code, language lighter; employ a **technical writer.**
- Time wasted is life lost. Save us, those of **utilities** abilities.
- Vision and decision make for accuracy and precision. Come down amongst the laypeople thou folk of **plans** who draw lines in sands. 

Additionally, *existing web-based mapping tools are complex, expensive, and built on top of ecosystems that were not web-first.* What if we can do better?
